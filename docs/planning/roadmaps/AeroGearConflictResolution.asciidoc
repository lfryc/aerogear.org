0.1.0 (Oct, 2014) Revision control     
----------------------------------
This goal of this version is to require minimal changes to existing servers and no special message format 
required between the client and the server.

AeroGear
~~~~~~~~
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-XXX[AEROGEAR-XXX] _Document server side contract for conflict detection/handling_. +
The only requirements on the server side is that it be able to detect when a conflict occurs and return a
HTTP 409 Conflict in response. The body/payload of the response must contains the server latest version of the 
data.

Android
~~~~~~~
[[android-resolver]]
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGDROID-XXX[AGDROID-XXX] _Conflict resolution handling_ + 
The API should be able to detect a 409 Conflict and allow the user to take action using callbacks. + 
Callback functions should be _success_, _conflict_, and _error_.
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGDROID-XXX[AGDROID-XXX] _DiffMatchPatch conflict resolver_ + 
A concrete conflict resolver that can uses DiffMatchPatch to resolve conflict. This resolver should be 
configurable to allow for auto-merging.


iOS

Callback functions should be _success_, _conflict_, and _error_.

A concrete conflict resolver that can uses DiffMatchPatch to resolve conflict. This resolver should be 
configurable to allow for auto-merging.

configurable to allow for auto-merging.


0.2.0 (Nov, 2014) Server push
-----------------------------
This version extends upon *0.1.0* to add support for the server to reach out and notify the client that there 
is a newer version available. This version requires that the server be updated to enable the sending of notifications when
data is updated, but there are no additional requirements apart from the requirements specified in *0.1.0*. +

The server may choose the most appropriate communication channel to use for notifying a client about a change, such as WebSocket or Push Notification. Specifically, the server is encouraged to reuse any existing real-time communication channel between the client and the server, such as WebSocket or Server-Sent Events.

UnifiedPush Server is an option for sending from the server side.

0.3.0 (Dec, 2014) Partial updates
---------------------------------

This version introduces a message protocol between the client and server. This enables efficient data exchange where minimal set of object modifications are sent 
between the client and server.

AeroGear
~~~~~~~~
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-XXX[AEROGEAR-XXX] _Document server side contract for partial updates_. +
The requirement of the server is to use HTTP PATCH method together with ETag header and partially updated content. The server understands HTTP PATCH requests with IETF link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902[JSON Patch] and link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-merge-patch-07[JSON Merge Patch] (draft) formats, where the appropriate format is specified by Content-type header defined by given format. The server supports automatic conflict resolution mode. The server uses appropriate response status codes and response body in case of merge with no conflict (200 OK, no response), resolved conflict (200 OK, response in format json-patch or json-merge-patch as specified by Accept header) or unresolvable conflict (409 Conflict, full response). +
The server is required to support HTTP HEAD method together with ETag header and respond 304 Not Modified if there is no conflict. +

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-XXX[AEROGEAR-XXX] _Epic for testing reference servers for Partial Updates_. +
The reference containers are checked for conformance of Partial Updates feature.

0.4.0 (Feb, 2015) Data Persistence / Offline, SPDY
--------------------------------------------------

The DataManager automatically stores data retrieved from server endpoint. Client SDKs provide a way how to connect DataManager with Pipeline and Resolver to allow for automatic updates and offline mode.

SPDY can be used as an efficient means of communication.



AeroGear
~~~~~~~~
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-XXX[AEROGEAR-XXX] _Document server side contract for optional usage of SPDY_. +
The server can support SPDY to allow for efficient synchronization with multiple endpoints.
* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AEROGEAR-XXX[AEROGEAR-XXX] _Epic for testing support of SPDY in reference containers_. +
The reference containers are checked for proper support of SPDY. The support should be documented or implemented as required.

0.5.0 (Apr, 2015) Batch Updates
-------------------------------

Client SDKs and Server API conforms to Batch API that will be designed for this purpose. The API reuses contracts established for Partial Updates feature. The link:http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/os/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-os-part1-protocol.html#_Toc372793748[OData Batch] format can be considered as a template format.
