== Database migration

Moving to the latest stable release of the UnifiedPush Server (version 1.0.3) may require some manual migration steps on your database!

=== 1.0.0 users

You need to migrate the data model for the UnifiedPush Server when upgrading to version 1.0.3 of the UnifiedPush Server. Up-to-date instructions are available in the +databases/migration/README.md+ file of the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/releases/latest[release bundle].

=== 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 users

The data model between our 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 releases are identically to our 1.0.3 release. This means there is no extra migration needed!

=== Upgrade problems?

In case you are using a different database than MySQL or PostgreSQL, or in any other issue please contact the link:/community[team]!
