image:./img/no_matching_provisionning_profile.png[No matching provisioning profile]


*Answer*

* have you changed your computer recently? If yes, if you provisioning profile was deliver in your previous machine, you need to migrate your provisioning profile, please follow link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-accounts_preferences/articles/export_signing_assets.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013306-CH8-SW1[Exporting Your Signing Identities and Provisioning Profiles] Apple documentation.
* is it the first time you use this app? have you followed the pre-requisite section on link:../provisioning-profiles[provisioning profile]?


## Question: APNs error

*Problem description*

You have implemented application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:. When launching the app, you get the eror no valid 'aps-environment':
[source,c]
----
Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3000 "no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application" UserInfo=0x1555edc0 {NSLocalizedDescription=no valid 'aps-environment' entitlement string found for application}
----

*Answer*

Your Bundle ID name should match with the Bundle ID as created on Apple's developer portal. Please refer to [Apple App ID and SSL certificate for APNs](app-id-sll-certificate-apns.asciidoc) documentation for more details on configuration.

### Question: My registration to UPS never happens

*Problem description*

The success callback application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: is never called.

*Answer*

* implement application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError: to track any issue with APN registration. In the body of the method, print an error message as shown below:
[source,c]
----
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error {
    // something went wrong, while talking to APNs
    // for now we simply log the error
    NSLog(@"APNs Error: %@", error);
}
----
If you do enter the failure callback then your problem is similar to link:#_question_apns_error[APNs error]

* If you do not enter the error callback, check you actually _did_ register for remote notifications. Note: with iOS8, your remote registration to APNs is splitted into 2 methods call. See code snippet in link:#_question_compilation_error_in_xcode6[Compilation error in Xcode6]

## Question: My registration fails because of nil deviceID

*Problem description*

UPS registration fails with the following error:

[source,c]
----
assertion failed: 'token' should be set: file /.../aerogear-push-ios-registration/push-sdk-swift/AGDeviceRegistration.swift, line 75
----

*Answer*

In application like link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-quickstarts/tree/master/client/contacts-mobile-ios-client[Contacts app] where UPS registration does not happen in AppDelegate but later in the flow, at Login, we save deviceID in NSUserDefaults within application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken. However, if the method application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: is not called, deviceID is nil causing UPS registration to fail.

To solve the problem, refer to link:#_question_my_registration_to_ups_never_happens[My registration to UPS never happens]

## Question: Compilation error in Xcode6

*Problem description*

When trying to run my Xcode5 app in Xcode6, I run into compilation error.

*Answer*

Since iO8, registerForRemoteNotificationTypes has been deprecated in favour of registerUserNotificationSettings: with registerForRemoteNotifications. The API unifies notification settings whether it's a remote or user notification. If you want to be able to run either using Xcode5 or Xcode6 on iOS7 or iOS8, use the macro as shown below:

[source,c]
----
#if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 80000
    if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {
        UIUserNotificationSettings* notificationSettings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound categories:nil];
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
    } else {
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
    }

#else
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
#endif
