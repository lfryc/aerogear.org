AeroGear provides a Java library that allows you to programmatically access and send notifications to the AeroGear Unified Push server. The library can be used in your standalone Java applications as well as be embedded in a Java EE environment. This guide will explain the features of the API as well as give example usages for both scenarios. We assume you are already familiar with the concepts of the AeroGear UnifiedPush server. If not, please visit the project's link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-server[github] page for more information.



== Installation

The library can be downloaded through the project link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unified-push-java-client[github] page or if you are using Maven, simply add the following dependency in your 'pom.xml':

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jboss.aerogear</groupId>
            <artifactId>unifiedpush-java-client</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.0</version>
        </dependency>

== API Overview

The API is straightforward to use and consists of the following methods:
  
[source,java]
----
public interface JavaSender {

    /**
     * Sends the given payload to installations of the referenced PushApplication.
     * We also pass a callback to handle the message.
     */
    void send(UnifiedMessage unifiedMessage, MessageResponseCallback callback);

    /**
     * Sends the given payload to installations of the referenced PushApplication.
     */
    void send(UnifiedMessage unifiedMessage);

    ...
}
----

The _UnifiedMessage_ object passed as a parameter on those methods contain the actual notification payload. The object, as we will see in the example later on, utilizes the builder pattern to help you construct easily the payload. The difference between the two methods, is that the first one allows you to pass a callback so that you can be notified regarding whether the notification was successfully accepted by the server for transmission.

A concrete implementation of the _JavaSender_ interface can be found on the 'SenderClient' class, which internally uses _HttpURLConnection_ for the communication (but can easily be adopted to support other http providers).

== Sending a message

Let's start now with a simple example where the notification is send to all mobile variants registered under the Push Application ID: 

[source,java]
----
JavaSender sender = new SenderClient.Builder("http://localhost:8080/ag-push").build();       // [1]

UnifiedMessage unifiedMessage = new UnifiedMessage.Builder()                 // [2]
                .pushApplicationId("c7fc6525-5506-4ca9-9cf1-55cc261ddb9c")  
                .masterSecret("8b2f43a9-23c8-44fe-bee9-d6b0af9e316b")
                .alert("Hello from Java Sender API!")
                .sound("default")
                .badge("1")
                .timeToLive(3600)  // [3]                                       
                .attribute("some_key", "with_value")  // [4]
                .attribute("title", "A Cool Title") // [5]
                .build();

sender.send(unifiedMessage, new MessageResponseCallback() {      // [6]

            @Override
            public void onComplete(int statusCode) {
              // check the 'statusCode' to determine whether the notification
              // was accepted for transmission by the server.
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Throwable throwable) {
              // an error occured during send
            }
          });
----

In [1] we initialize the client passing the hostname of the running AeroGear UnifiedPush Server. If the hostname changes, you will need to create a new instance of the client.

In [2], we access the builder object and we use it to fill in the parameters. The _pushApplicationId_ and _masterSecret_ params are used to identify the particular Push Application on the UnifiedPush server as well as performing authentication against it. You were given them when you initially registered your PushApplication with the server. Ensure they are present and valid, otherwise there will be an error when trying to send. 

An optional _timeToLive_ [3] (in seconds) can be added on the notification payload, instructing the remote provider to drop the notification in case the device is unable to receive it (e.g. offline) for a period longer than the seconds specified. 

Further, support is provided with the help of the _attribute_ param [4], to attach on the notification arbitrary key/value pairs that make sense on your business context. Those pairs will eventually be interpreted by your client code once the notification arrives. 

The optional _title_ attribute [5], is a cordova Android specific attribute that will be used when displaying the notification in the notification panel. The default will be the cordova appName.  

Once the notification payload is constructed, we invoke the send method [6] passing along our callback. If there was an error during send, then the 'onError' callback method would be called otherwise 'onComplete' would be called with the 'statusCode' initialized to the response code as returned from the server. Normally, a status code of '200' would be returned to indicate that the server accepted it for transmission. Check the link:http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-unifiedpush-rest/sender/index.html[server documentation] for a list of valid responses.

== Selected send

To narrow down the list of the recipients, you are given the following options: (shown with the respective builder method)

- narrow down by specific mobile variants (e.g. HR Android, HR iPhone):
[source,java]
----
    variants(Arrays.asList("c3f0a94f-48de-4b77-a08e..." /* HR_Premium */, "444939cd-ae63-4ce1-96a4..." /* HR_Free */));
----
- narrow down by specific aliases, thus allowing to send a message directly to a specific mobile installation. Note that here we used an email address, but anything that helps to identify a user can be used (e.g. username, user ID, etc)
[source,java]
----
    .aliases(Arrays.asList("john@somewhere.com", "maria@somewhere.com"));
----
- narrow down by specific device types:
[source,java]
----
    .deviceType(Arrays.asList("iPhone", "iPad_Mini", "web"));
----
- narrow down by specific categories:
[source,java]
----
   .categories("someCategory", "otherCategory");
----
- narrow down SimplePush clients:
[source,java]
----
   .simplePush("version");
----

NOTE: All these query criterias are optional. If no criterias are passed it will act as a broadcast send, where all clients are notified.

As you realize from the list, the Sender API offers _tremendous_ flexibility in supporting even the most complex scenarios. You can mix and match options to target a specific mobile audience. 

Once the UnifiedMessage is build with your desired criterias, simply call the _send_ method on the JavaSender to send the notification.

== iOS specific payload

For iOS, you are given the following options: (shown with the respective builder method)

- An iOS specific argument to send notifications to Newsstand applications and submitting silent iOS notifications (iOS7)
[source,java]
----
   .contentAvailable()
----

- An iOS specific argument to pass an Action Category for interactive notifications (iOS8)
[source,java]
----
   .actionCategory("acceptLead")
----

== Connect via a Proxy

If your infrastructure is behind a proxy, you can specify this while creating an instance of your SenderClient : 
[source,java]
----
JavaSender defaultJavaSender = new SenderClient.Builder()
                .rootServerURL("http://localhost:8080/ag-push")
                .proxy("proxy.example.com", 8080)
                .proxyUser("proxyuser")
                .proxyPassword("password")
                .proxyType(Proxy.Type.HTTP)
                .build();
----

== Use a custom Trustore

If your infrastructure uses a custom TrustStore, you can specify this while creating an instance of your SenderClient : 

[source,java]
----
JavaSender defaultJavaSender = new SenderClient.Builder()
                .rootServerURL("https://localhost:8080/ag-push")
                .customTrustStore("setup/aerogear.truststore", "jks", "aerogear")
                .build();
----


== Integrating with Java EE

The library can be used inside a Java EE environment to enable your enterprise applications to send notification messages to mobile clients, when e.g. a particular business event occurs. Let's see one approach of integration through an example of a PaymentGateway.

A payment request is initiated through a REST endpoint. The endpoint delegates the processing to an EJB and if the transaction succeeds, a CDI Payment Event is fired. The event is then picked up from CDI Observer bean, which then uses the JavaSender API to send a notification back to client.

[source,java]
----
/**
 *  Various resource produces e.g. PersistentContext etc.
 */
public class Resources {

    // ...

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    public SenderClient getSenderClient() {
       // initialize to point to the hostname of the running UnifiedPush server
       return  new SenderClient.Builder("http://localhost:8080/ag-push").build();
    }
}
----

Payment.java

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Models a payment
 */
 public class Payment {

    private String userAlias;
    private BigDecimal amount;
    private Date datetime;

    public BigDecimal getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public void setAmount(BigDecimal amount) {
        this.amount = amount;
    }

    public String getUserAlias() {
        return userAlias;
    }

    public void setUserAlias(String userAlias) {
        this.userAlias = userAlias;
    }
}
----

PaymentResource.java

[source,java]
----
/**
 *  A JAX-RS endpoint for clients to kickstart payment processing
 */
 @Path("/payments")
 public class PaymentResource {

  @Inject
  PaymentsProcessor processor;

  @POST
  @Consumes("application/json")
  public Response pay(Payment payment) {
    processor.pay(payment)

    return Response.ok().build();
  }    
}
----

PaymentsProcessor.java

[source,java]
----
/**
 *  The EJB responsible for processing the payment
 */
@Stateless
public class PaymentsProcessor {

    @Inject
    Event<Payment> event;

    public void pay(Payment payment) {
        // process the payment
        // ...

        event.fire(payment);
    }
}
----

NotificationSender.java

[source,java]
----
/**
 * The class that listens for payment events 
 * and responsible to send receipt notifications
 */
public class NotificationSender {

  @Inject 
  SenderClient sender;

  // here the CDI 'Payment' event is caught and the actual send is triggered
  void sendPaymentNotification(@Observes(during = AFTER_SUCCESS) Payment payment) { 
      UnifiedMessage unifiedMessage = new UnifiedMessage.Builder()
                .pushApplicationId("c7fc6525-5506-4ca9-9cf1-55cc261ddb9c")  
                .masterSecret("8b2f43a9-23c8-44fe-bee9-d6b0af9e316b")
                .alert("Thank you for your payment!")
                .sound("default")
                .aliases(Arrays.asList(payment.getUserAlias()))
                .build();

      sender.send(message)
  }
}
----

== Conclusion

The Sender API is simple and easy to use, allowing you to connect to the UnifiedPush server and send notifications. It can be used both in your standalone applications or be embedded in a Java EE environment. Work is being done to port it to other languages too and if you are interested you can give us a hand too!
