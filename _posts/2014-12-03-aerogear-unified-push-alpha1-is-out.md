We are happy to announce that the [Unified Push Server 1.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server/releases/tag/1.1.0-alpha.1) has been released ! 

## What is new ?

The big new feature is the support of Windows Push ! Take a look at our [Windows Push HelloWorld quickstart](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-helloworld/tree/master/windows) and [the Windows Tutorial](http://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-windows/) to help you to get started.

Another cool feature that has been added is the Import/Export of installations. From the admin console, you can now easily extract in JSON format all the installations from a variant. The same way, you can import a set of installations for a particular variant.

Besides that, a bunch of bugs have been fixed, you can check the full list [here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGPUSH/fixforversion/12326300?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:version-issues-panel).

Stay tuned !
