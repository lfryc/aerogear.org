## Highlights

### AeroGear-JS

AeroGear-JS 1.0.0.M1 lays down the foundation for data synchronization and security.

- Authentication / Authorization
- Memory based data manager to separate data management from pipeline
- Data Synchronization groundwork including data status tracking (new, modified, removed)

API documentation can be found on the [project website](http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-js/) and a [TODO app demo](https://github.com/aerogear/TODO) is available to see these new options in action.

### AeroGear-iOS

AeroGear-iOS 1.0.0.M1 introduces a simple API to communicate against RESTful endpoints, and much more!

- Authentication / Authorization
- Data Synchronization groundwork (in-memory storage for now)

You can find a pretty comprehensive API usage example into a [TODO app demo](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-todo-ios).

## What's next?

We are already working to bring out of the oven improvements to AeroGear-Controller, AeroGear-Security and AeroGear-Android. Stay tuned!
