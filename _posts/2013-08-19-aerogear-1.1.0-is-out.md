We're happy to announce the immediate availability of **AeroGear 1.1.0**

## Push Notifications

The August release of AeroGear is focused around _Push Notifications_. Our client APIs got support for their matching platforms and two servers have been developed.

### One Server to rule them all

The [AeroGear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server) has currently support for three different mobile platforms:

* Android and Google Cloud Messaging
* iOS and Apple Push Notification Service
* JavaScript and Mozilla's SimplePush

Details can be found in [this blog post](http://matthiaswessendorf.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/aerogear-push-notifications).


### APNs support for iOS

The AeroGear iOS project got a new tiny library that helps iOS application to register with the above mentioned AeroGear UnifiedPush Server. Take a look [here](http://matthiaswessendorf.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/aerogear-ios-apns) for details about what the iOS project offers!

## JavaScript

AeroGear.js is releasing version 1.2.0 which is centered around all things push. Included in this release is a client implementation and polyfill for Mozilla's SimplePush specification as well as a client for the new AeroGear UnifiedPush server which allows easy management of push notifications across Android (GCM), iOS (APNS) and the web (SimplePush). We have also made some documentation improvements and added some new integration testing and continuous integration features.

## Android 

AeroGear Android is releasing version 1.2.0 which brings support for push messaging using Google Cloud Messaging with [AeroGear UnifiedPush Server](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-unifiedpush-server) to the library.  Included in this release is a set of APIs for connecting to and handling messages from the AeroGear UnifiedPush Server as well as utility classes for managing GCM registration and message consumption.  We've also provided a nifty [tutorial](/docs/guides/aerogear-push-android) as well as the basic [javadocs](/docs/specs/aerogear-android/) and an [API overview](/docs/guides/aerogear-android/AerogearAndroidPush).
