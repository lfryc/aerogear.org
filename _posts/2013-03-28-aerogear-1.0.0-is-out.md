We're happy to announce the immediate availability of **AeroGear 1.0.0**

![](/img/news/potomac_consolidated_tracon.jpg)

A huge thank you to the AeroGear team and the open source community!

## Recap

For quite a while, we have been busy in implementing our ideas for a 1.0.0 release. As you know, the library offers three overall components

* Mobile Client SDKs (for Android, JavaScript and iOS)
* Server Side Framework (the Controller)
* Security accross all the layers (server and client)

## Highlights

### Android

AeroGear for Android is available for versions 2.3.3 and greater.  In addition to the base AeroGear functionality we have provided utilities to integrate with the Android Activity lifecycle.  This allows your applications to be more stable, require less memory, and run faster.  We have also put together many guides on getting started, written tutorials covering simple and advanced use cases, gathered several sample applications, and much much more all covered in our [Android section](/android).


### iOS

Besides two iOS libraries, we also deliver a Xcode Template for an easy development experience! For more details on this release, checkout this [blog post](http://matthiaswessendorf.wordpress.com/2013/03/28/aerogear-ios-1-0-0/)!

### JavaScript

The JavaScript library provides pluggable, easy to use APIs for authentication, data management and persistence. Check out this [blog post](http://blog.krisborchers.com/2013/03/28/aerogear-js-1-0-0-has-landed/) for details.

### Controller
The AeroGear Controller provides you with a server-side lightweight mvc controller. Check out this [blog post](http://dbevenius.org/) for details.

### Security

On AeroGear we've been working towards security provider integration and mitigating risks on mobile web (as you know, security is hard). During this release we spent some time improving AeroGear OTP, AeroGear Security and mitigating risks. A quick overview can be seen [here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/agsec).
